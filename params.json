The\r\n    administration panel in torrentflux-b4rt includes a large number of\r\n    options to allow you fine grained control over every aspect of your\r\n    bittorrent/transfers usage.\r\n\r\n    TorrentFlux-NG is also a multi-user application, allowing you to\r\n    create individual accounts and assign restrictions to those accounts\r\n    as you wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n## Features\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n    Please see the FEATURES file for a comprehensive list of\r\n    Torrentflux-b4rt features.\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n## Requirements\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n    Due to the extensible nature of torrentflux-b4rt, there are a\r\n    variety of 3rd party tools/utilities and extra functionality that\r\n    can be enabled from within the administration control panel.\r\n\r\n    TorrentFlux-NG also features a service daemon called Fluxd which\r\n    can be used to schedule rss feed downloads, keep watch over running\r\n    torrents and restart them if they die.\r\n\r\n    The 3rd party utils/functionality and Fluxd all have their own\r\n    requirements.  For this reason the requirements section is split\r\n    into the following sections:\r\n\r\n        3.1 Minimum Requirements\r\n        3.2 Additional/Optional Feature Requirements\r\n        3.3 Fluxd Requirements\r\n\r\n    ALWAYS install the required items from the package installation\r\n    manager for your OS whenever possible.  This will save a lot of time\r\n    and headaches, and ensure all the dependencies are installed\r\n    correctly. See your OS documentation for details about the software\r\n    management systems available on your OS.\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n### Minimum Requirements\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n    This section lists the minimum requirements required to operate\r\n    torrentflux with the basic core functionality.  This list may\r\n    seem daunting, but most Unix like OSs have many of these features\r\n    available as part of their software distribution system.\r\n\r\n    ******************************************************************\r\n    Notes:\r\n    =====\r\n\r\n    - The following lists are NOT exhaustive - if you use a Unix like\r\n      OS/webserver/database/etc not listed below, basic functionality of\r\n      torrentflux-b4rt may well work.  Success reports installing\r\n      torrentflux-b4rt on other OSs other than those below above are\r\n      welcome on the forum:\r\n\r\n            http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/forum/\r\n\r\n    - IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED THAT YOU INSTALL THE COMPONENTS LISTED\r\n      BELOW FROM THE SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INCLUDED WITH YOUR OS\r\n      (ie apt-get, rpm package management, FreeBSD ports system, etc).\r\n    ******************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n    The core minimum requirements follow below:\r\n\r\n    o A Unix like OS (no Win32 support).\r\n      Current tested OSs include:\r\n\r\n        * Linux:\r\n            o Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, RedHat, Fedora, NSLU2,\r\n              ClarkConnect - amongst others\r\n\r\n            Note:\r\n            =====\r\n            SELinux should be turned off.\r\n\r\n        * BSD:\r\n            o FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD\r\n\r\n        * Apple:\r\n            o Mac OS X\r\n\r\n\r\n    o A Web Server.\r\n      Current tested webservers include:\r\n\r\n        * Apache\r\n            http://www.apache.org/\r\n\r\n        * LightTPD\r\n            http://www.lighttpd.net/\r\n\r\n\r\n    o An SQL-Database.\r\n      Currently Supported databases:\r\n\r\n        * MySQL\r\n            http://www.mysql.com/\r\n\r\n        * SQLite\r\n            http://www.sqlite.org/\r\n\r\n        * PostgreSQL\r\n            http://www.postgresql.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n    o PHP in 'web mode' (ie mod_php or php-cgi - preferably mod_php) >=\r\n      4.3.x built with database (MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL), session,\r\n      sockets and PCRE support enabled.  For image recognition/captcha\r\n\t  support for logins, GD support must be enabled in PHP.\r\n\r\n    o PHP in 'commandline mode' (php-cli) >= 4.3.x built with database\r\n      (MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL), session, sockets and PCRE support\r\n      enabled.\r\n\r\n        http://www.php.net/\r\n\r\n        PHP Notes:\r\n        ==========\r\n        o Safe Mode must be turned off:\r\n            * php.ini: safe_mode = Off\r\n\r\n        o Allow Url fopen must be allowed:\r\n            * php.ini: allow_url_fopen = On\r\n\r\n        o open_basedir must be empty:\r\n            * php.ini: open_basedir = ''\r\n\r\n            Note: some web control panels like cPanel use\r\n            open_basedir to restrict users as to what they can do with\r\n            PHP.  torrentflux-b4rt does NOT officially support\r\n            installations on shared hosting platforms due to the\r\n            complications that arise (such as the use of open_basedir\r\n            amongst many other things).  However if you do choose to\r\n            attempt to install torrentflux-b4rt on a shared host running\r\n            a control panel such as cPanel, be aware of the problems\r\n            open_basedir can cause.\r\n\r\n            Please see:\r\n\r\n            http://php.net/manual/en/features.safe-mode.php#ini.open-basedir\r\n\r\n            for more info.\r\n\r\n        o As mentioned above, both the PHP web module and the\r\n          commandline / cli binary must be installed, both with support\r\n          for the database you plan to use and with support for PCRE and\r\n          sessions.  Check the package management system\r\n          documentation/website for your OS for more info on installing\r\n          PHP with support for web and cli.\r\n\r\n\r\n    o Python is required for the BitTorrent, BitTornado and Azureus\r\n      bittorrent clients:\r\n\r\n        * Python >= 2.2 for BitTornado\r\n        * Python >= 2.4 for BitTorrent Mainline (original 'BitTorrent client)\r\n        * Python >= 2.2.1 for Azureus\r\n\r\n\r\n    o Perl >= 5.6 or higher for fluxd, nzbperl.pl, ttools.pl and\r\n      fluxpoller.pl.  See section 3.2 below for extra info.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Once more(!), it is highly advisable to install these requirements\r\n    using the recommended package management system for your OS.\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n### Additional/Optional Feature Requirements\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n    The following is a list of additional requirements needed before\r\n    enabling additional features and options in torrentflux-b4rt.  By\r\n    default these options or features are disabled and can be enabled\r\n    via the administration panel - please ensure the requirements are\r\n    installed before enabling additional features.\r\n\r\n    As mentioned above, it is strongly advised that these requirements\r\n    are installed from your OS's software distribution system to ensure\r\n    all dependencies are installed correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Additional/optional feature requirements follow below:\r\n\r\n    o BitTorrent Mainline Client requirements:\r\n\r\n        * PyCrypto (Python Cryptography Toolkit)\r\n            http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycrypto/\r\n\r\n        * Twisted Python libs\r\n            http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/\r\n\r\n            Note:\r\n            =====\r\n            Twisted also requires Zope Interface >=3.0.1\r\n                http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface/\r\n\r\n            see Twisted installation docs for more info.\r\n\r\n\r\n    o Azureus/Vuze Client requirements:\r\n\r\n        * Azureus 2.5.0.0 or higher with the XML/HTTP Plugin\r\n            http://azureus.sourceforge.net\r\n            http://azureus.sourceforge.net/plugin_details.php?plugin=xml_http_if\r\n\r\n        see azureus installation doc (doc/azureus.txt) for more info.\r\n\r\n        A new interface with xmwebui rpc interface will come soon...\r\n\r\n\r\n    o wget transfer functionality requirements:\r\n        * wget\r\n            http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/\r\n\r\n\r\n    o nzbperl.pl requirements:\r\n\r\n        * UUDeview\r\n            http://fpx.de/fp/Software/UUDeview/\r\n\r\n        The following perl modules are also required for nzbperl:\r\n\r\n        * IO::File\r\n        * IO::Select\r\n        * IO::Socket::INET\r\n        * File::Basename\r\n        * Getopt::Long\r\n        * Cwd\r\n        * XML::Simple\r\n        * XML::DOM\r\n\r\n        Optional nzbperl perl modules:\r\n\r\n        * Threads\r\n        * Thread::Queue\r\n\r\n\r\n    o Archive (rar/zip) extraction functionality requirements:\r\n\r\n        * unrar\r\n            http://www.rarlab.com/rar/\r\n\r\n\r\n    o SFV file integrity checking functionality requirements:\r\n\r\n        * cksfv\r\n            http://zakalwe.fi/~shd/foss/cksfv/\r\n\r\n\r\n    o vlc streaming functionality requirements:\r\n        * vlc\r\n            http://www.videolan.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n    o ttools.pl is an alternative BitTorrent metadata client that\r\n      supports metadata scraping.  It can be enabled in the\r\n      Administration panel.  It requires the following modules:\r\n\r\n        * Digest::SHA1     (perl -MCPAN -e \"install Digest::SHA1\")\r\n        * LWP::UserAgent   (perl -MCPAN -e \"install LWP::UserAgent\")\r\n\r\n    o Mac OS X specific:\r\n\r\n        o Compilation of Transmission on Mac OS X requirements:\r\n            * Apple Developer Tools\r\n                http://developer.apple.com/tools/\r\n\r\n        o wget functionality on Mac OS X requirements:\r\n            * wget\r\n                http://www.statusq.org/images/wget.zip\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n### Fluxd Requirements\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n    The fluxd daemon works as part of torrentflux-b4rt to run in the\r\n    background on your server performing various tasks that you\r\n    schedule.  Fluxd is started from the Administration control panel -\r\n    by default it is not running.\r\n\r\n    Fluxd is written in the Perl scripting language and requires a\r\n    number of perl modules to run.  In the following list, the perl\r\n    command is given for you to install the corresponding module from\r\n    CPAN.  HOWEVER, most of these modules should be available from your\r\n    OS's package management system and it is strongly advised that you\r\n    install the modules from there rather than directly using the perl\r\n    CPAN system.\r\n\r\n    The required perl modules are as follows:\r\n\r\n    o Core fluxd functionality:\r\n\r\n        * IO::Select       (perl -MCPAN -e \"install IO::Select\")\r\n        * IO::Socket::UNIX (perl -MCPAN -e \"install IO::Socket::UNIX\")\r\n        * IO::Socket::INET (perl -MCPAN -e \"install IO::Socket::INET\")\r\n        * POSIX            (perl -MCPAN -e \"install POSIX\")\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT:\r\n    ==========\r\n    Additionally, Fluxd uses a PHP based helper script called\r\n    fluxcli.php and for this to run correctly the commandline (cli)\r\n    version of PHP must be installed with the correct extensions\r\n    (database, PCRE, socket and session support).  See the notes above\r\n    in section 3.1 for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n    o (Optional) Fluxd database connectivity using Perl DBI - Perl DBI\r\n      db connectivity is not required to run Fluxd.  The option exists\r\n      to enable perl DBI however in the Admin panel.  The following\r\n      modules are required to run Fluxd in Perl DBI mode:\r\n\r\n       * all database-types:\r\n         DBI              (perl -MCPAN -e \"install Bundle::DBI\")\r\n\r\n       * MySQL:\r\n         DBD::mysql       (perl -MCPAN -e \"install DBD::mysql\")\r\n\r\n       * SQLite:\r\n         DBD::SQLite      (perl -MCPAN -e \"install DBD::SQLite\")\r\n\r\n       * PostgreSQL:\r\n         DBD::Pg          (perl -MCPAN -e \"install DBD::Pg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n    o (Optional) Fluxinet functionality requirements - Fluxinet allows\r\n      remote connections directly to the Fluxd daemon over TCP.  It\r\n      is not enabled by default:\r\n\r\n       * IO::Select       (perl -MCPAN -e \"install IO::Select\")\r\n\r\n       * IO::Socket::INET (perl -MCPAN -e \"install IO::Socket::INET\")\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n## Installation\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\n    TorrentFlux-NG can be installed quickly from a web browser using\r\n    the included setup script.
